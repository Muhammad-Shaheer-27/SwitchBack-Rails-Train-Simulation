# SwitchbackRails
Developed a basic logic driven interactable train simulation system as a part of a Programming Project using C++.
The project simulates a train system involving tracks, switches, safety tiles etc.
Key aspects include:
algorithmic spawn and destination handling, 
dynamic path finding, 
priority based collision logic, 
variable parameters(weather,swtich states) which effect the train routing, and a 
logging system.
4 different levels with potential of expansion.
The key purpose of this project was to develop a foundational level understanding of C++, enabling us to focus on and develop real life applications of the language.
