# SwitchbackRails
Developed a basic logic driven interactable train simulation system as a part of a Programming Project using C++.
The project simulates a train system involving tracks, switches, safety tiles etc.
Key aspects include:
Algorithmic spawn and destination handling.
Dynamic Path Finding
Priority Based Collision Logic
Variable Parameters(weather,swtich states) which effect the train routing.
Logging system.
4 different levels with potential of expansion.
The key purpose of this project was to develop a foundational level understanding of C++, enabling us to focus on and develop real life applications of the language.
